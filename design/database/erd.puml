  Class relations, possibly with labels.

  Note: One can use `u`, `r`, `d`, `b` values in relation syntax
        (e.g. `author|o-b-o{books`).


        It allows to request some table to be put `up` / `right`
        / `bottom` / `left` relative to some other table.

        This seems to be undocumented, but it works.
