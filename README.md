# Organization app

Team project: PV281 Programming in Rust (Autumn 2023)

## Usage

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

## Assignment

A web application with several features that would facilitate the organization of music events and concerts.
It would be an application with login (several different levels of rights), adding, removing, and editing employees,
individual concerts, associated companies, staff, and temporary positions...

The main function would be for part-time workers. It would be a logging of hours worked (the part-time worker
would choose a given month, a given event, and a given day the event took place and log how much he worked in that position)
then the application would calculate the price he should get (including taxes).

The application would include a frontend (the website itself) and a backend that will take care of all the logic and database,
possibly the actual deployment to the domain and server. Optional extensions were the ability to add, remove, and the ability
to view event schedules where instructions would be listed for employees.
